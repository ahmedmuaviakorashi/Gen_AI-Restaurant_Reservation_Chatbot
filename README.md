### 1. Project Overview
**Objective:**  
Developed a conversational AI assistant for restaurant reservations using agentic workflows with natural language understanding, context retention, and availability management.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Fully functional Streamlit frontend interface
- ✅ Complete LangGraph agent pipeline implementation
- ✅ Groq API integration with Llama-3-70b model
- ✅ SQLite database for reservation management
- ✅ Comprehensive Pydantic validation system

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Core Components Delivered:**
1. **Agent Nodes:**
   - Intent extraction with LLM
   - Entity tracking and merging
   - Availability checking
   - Reservation creation/modification/cancellation

2. **Conversation Flow:**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B(Intent Extraction)
    B --> C[Entity Tracking]
    C --> D{Complete?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Availability Check]
    D -->|No| B
    E -->|Available| F[Create Reservation]
    E -->|Unavailable| G[Suggest Alternatives]
    G --> H[User Selects Slot]
    H --> F
    F --> I[Confirm Reservation]
    I --> J((END))
   ```

3. **Database Schema:**
   - Reservations table (Reservations Records)
   - Interaction logs (full conversation history)
