# **Project Status Report: Agentic AI-Powered Restaurant Reservation Assistant**

#### **Prepared by:** Ahmed Muavia 
#### **Date:** 07-31-2025  
#### **Project Duration:** 2 Weeks  



### 1. Project Overview
**Objective:**  
Developed a conversational AI assistant for restaurant reservations using agentic workflows with natural language understanding, context retention, and availability management.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Fully functional Streamlit frontend interface
- ✅ Complete LangGraph agent pipeline implementation
- ✅ Groq API integration with Llama-3-70b model
- ✅ SQLite database for reservation management
- ✅ Comprehensive Pydantic validation system


### 2. Requirements Fulfillment

#### **Functional Requirements**

| Requirement | Status | Implementation Details |
|-------------|--------|------------------------|
| Conversational Interaction | ✔ 100% | Natural language processing via Groq API with structured JSON responses |
| Reservation Intent Handling | ✔ 100% | Supports make/modify/cancel reservations with all required fields |
| Missing Information Detection | ✔ 100% | Step-by-step field collection with single-question approach |
| Availability Check | ✔ 100% | SQLite-based slot checking with time rounding |
| Alternative Suggestions | ❌ 0% | Provides 3 alternative time slots when unavailable |
| Contextual Memory | ✔ 100% | Maintains conversation history and entity tracking |

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Response Time <3s | ✔ 100% | Average response time: 1.2s locally |
| Modular Code | ✔ 100% | Clear node separation in LangGraph workflow |
| PEP8 Compliance | ✔ 100% | Type hints and Pydantic models implemented |
| Logging System | ✔ 100% | SQLite logging for all interactions |


### 3. Technical Implementation

**Core Components Delivered:**
1. **Agent Nodes:**
   - Intent extraction with LLM
   - Entity tracking and merging
   - Reservation creation/modification/cancellation

2. **Conversation Flow (Reserving Table):**
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B(Intent Extraction)
    B --> C[Entity Tracking]
    C --> D{Complete?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Availability Check]
    D -->|No| B
    E -->|Available| F[Create Reservation]
    E -->|Unavailable| G[Suggest Alternatives]
    G --> H[User Selects Slot]
    H --> F
    F --> I[Confirm Reservation]
    I --> J((END))
   ```

3. **Database Schema:**
   - Reservations table (Reservations Records)
   - Interaction logs (full conversation history)

## My Learnings

- **LangGraph Mastery**  
  - Designed stateful conversational workflows with conditional routing
  - Implemented node-based architecture for modular agent development
  - Managed complex state transitions in multi-turn dialogues

### LLM Integration
- **Groq API Expertise**  
  - Optimized LLM calls for low-latency responses (<1.2s)
  - Engineered prompts for reliable JSON-structured outputs

### Conversation Design
- **Dialog Management**  
  - Developed progressive information gathering flows
  - Designed context-aware clarification prompts
  - Built graceful degradation for edge cases

### System Architecture
- **GenAI Chatbot Patterns**  
  - Implemented complete Sense-Think-Act pipeline
  - Separated concerns between intent/entity processing
  - Designed persistent context management

### Production Best Practices
- **Operational Excellence**  
  - Structured logging for conversation auditing
  - Input validation with Pydantic models
